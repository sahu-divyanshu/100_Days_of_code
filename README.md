# #100 DAYS OF CODE CHALLENGE
![100 DAYS OF CODE CHALLENGE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106388215/178993186-17265243-9b66-4eda-84f0-4176cda3d9b8.png)
### I accepted the [#100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) to improve and learn something new every day for at least an hour. That way, I can enhance my coding skills.

* I Will Follow Two Basic Rules: 

     1. Code for at least one hour per day for the following 100 days.
   
     2. Every day I'm going to update on LinkedIn with my progress using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

* My Exceptions Are:

     1. If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day.

     2. My college exam, as well as a few emergencies, necessitates a day off
